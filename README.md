This is a travel guidance web application.
In this project, we make use of a service called RAPID API to get restaurants, hotels and places of attractions from all over the world. Then we display we use google maps and material-ui cards to display play them as  the user zoom into any city. They can know about the price tags the number of reviews and even the awayds that the place has gotten. They can also visit the place directly as gthe website is directly attached to the card.
